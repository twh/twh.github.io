I design, build, and maintain state-of-the-art networks and supercomputers. Iâ€™ve worked in computing and systems engineering roles for a variety of institutions such as Duke University, Caltech, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Currently I am working on NVIDIA GPU based compute clusters at <a href="https://www.tempus.com">Tempus</a>, which aquired my previous company Paige AI.
